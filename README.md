DataViz Bootcamp HW

*Note Raw data CSV files were to large to add to github*

Dataset was retrived from: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. 

Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.

Create your final presentation:

Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
